### Hi there! I'm Kirsten 👋
I'm an IT Manager and Data Engineer based in Manila, Philippines.

I've worked with various types of projects and have used multiple programming languages. Ever since I was young, I fell in love programming and built so many things from fullstack websites to machine learning models. 

#### My background
I'm a Computer Science graduate who started her early career in software engineering at a YC fintech startup. I contributed on backend functionalities using React, Postgres and other third party tools used for tracking user behaviour. In the same company I transitioned to data science where I conducted data studies to identify suspicious profiles and transactions for early prevention of potential money laundering schemes. I was also a researcher for De La Salle University working on a multidiscipline study in network science and NLP where I worked on multiplex networks, clustering algorithms, and graph databases.

Currently I'm in the FMCG industry with a hybrid role of Engineering Manager and Data Engineer. I build ETL pipelines in Azure for internal business consumption, as well as work with external partners on creating and optimizing platform features for developed and scaled systems.

#### Some things about me...
- 👀 I’m interested in Big Data and Generative AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data engineering with Azure
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in DE
